# django-nuxt
Template for a Django/Nuxt PWA with axios, vuex, REST, JWT auth, markdown blog, etc.

## What is this?
I'm working on a Django Nuxt PWA and it is tedious to get all the basic workflows going. While there is a lot of material out there on how to build a simple app, it's hard to figure out more advanced concepts, especially when you build your first Django/Nuxt app. This is an attempt to create a template for a Django/Nuxt PWA that has all essentials included and you can basically just clone it and have all the boilerplate working:

- Django backend with REST API
- Vue/Nuxt Universal PWA frontend with axios request library
- JSON Web Token (JWT) authentication (local, Facebook, Google)
- Password reset with magic links
- Fontawesome integration
- Markdown blog with lazy image loading (based on https://github.com/marinaaisa/nuxt-markdown-blog-starter)

Stack: Python 3, PostgreSQL, Django 3, RESTframework, Vue 2, Axios, Vuex, Nuxt, HTML5, SCSS.
