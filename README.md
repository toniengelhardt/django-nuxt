# django-nuxt
Template for a Django/Nuxt PWA with axios, vuex, REST, JWT auth, markdown blog, etc.

## Why?
I'm working on a Django Nuxt PWA and it is hard to compile all the resources. While there is a lot of material out there on how to build a simple app, it's tedious to figure out more advanced concepts, especially when you build your first Django/Nuxt app. This is an attempt to create a template for a Django/Nuxt PWA that has all essentials included and you can pick what you need:

- Django backend with REST API
- Vue/Nuxt Universal PWA frontend with axios request library
- JSON Web Token (JWT) authentication (local, Facebook, Google)
- Markdown blog

Stack: Python 3, Django 3, RESTframework, Vue 2, Vuex, Nuxt, Axios, HTML5, SCSS.
